# Classification of Fetal Health Data

This project endeavors to apply machine learning algorithms to a dataset of fetal health data to determine whether a given pregnancy should be classified as Normal, Suspect, or Pathological. The data for this study was derived from Cardiotocograms, a simple and inexpensive method of accessing fetal health measures, such as heart rate and fetal movement. This classification problem is important because of the elevated rates of child mortality in many parts of the world. If one can easily identify whether certain Cardiotocogram data indicates an unhealthy fetus, then one can intervene quickly to treat the underlying illnesses and increase the chances of a healthy delivery. For the purposes of this project the K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest Algorithm, Support Vector Machines, and Gradient Boosting algorithms will be used and compared for error, precision, recall, and AUC.
